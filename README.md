# battlesim

A program to simulate battles between 2 Fire Emblem Sacred Stones units.

Goals are to implement levelling up with growth rates, different weapons & promotion.

Small number of units & weapons to begin with.

Magic has been named strength to make the variable name simpler. Magic units still target res over def as expected
